# Basic Existential Kink Meditation

## Situation that conscious mind or ego doesn’t like
_Identify a situation you have experienced that you didn't like._

## Associated feelings and emotions
_Identify the breadth of feelings and emotions that arose in that experience, especially the ones that you consciously fight against._

## Admissions, allowances, and permission to actually, passionately enjoy feelings and emotions
_Consider what might be possibly good or valuable to you in those experiences. What does it allow to the true?_

## Present value, gratitude, and pleasure from shadow
_Identify what the shadow appreciates and loves about this situation._

## Position from shadow
_Get on the side of your shadow—your previously unconscious sense of desire/curiosity/enjoyment—and deliberately, consciously, humbly allow yourself to receive, feel big gratitude for, and get off on the situation your unconscious so brilliantly created._
